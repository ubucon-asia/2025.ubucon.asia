## Reporting an Incident
### Procedure For Reporting Code of Conduct Incidents
If you believe someone has violated Code of Conducts, we encourage you to report it. If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still report it. We are fine with receiving reports where we decide to take no action for the sake of creating a safer community.

You can make a report by emailing coc@ubucon.asia. You may send your report using local language if you have difficulties communicating using common language (English language). For urgent matters, You may also contact one of our CoC Board members directly with matrix chat using matrix chat handles listed below. Your report will be received by the following UbuCon Asia Code of Conduct Board members:

| Name | Email | Matrix chat | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Muhd Syazwan | jipangmenjerit@gmail.com | @jipangmenjerit:matrix.org | CoC Board Chair / Global team |
| Youngbin Han (한영빈) | ybhan@ubuntu.com | @ybhan:ubuntu.com | Global team |
| Khairul Aizat Kamarudzzaman | fenris@ubuntu.com | @fenris:ubuntu.com | Global team |
| Aaditya Singh | aadityasingh@gnome.org | @aadii:matrix.org | Local Team (Nepal) |
| Sailesh Singh | sailesh36687@gmail.com | @saileshsingh:matrix.org | Local Team (Nepal) |

If your report concerns one of the people listed above, please mail any of the others directly instead of using the coc@ubucon.asia list. The CoC Board has procedures to deal with such cases; please see the section “Conflicts of Interest” below.

### Report Data
If you make a report via email, we hope you can provide us with some information that will help us identify the reported person. If you don’t remember all the details, we still encourage you to make a report.

We encourage you to include the following information in your report:
- Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
- Date and time of the incident
- Whether the incident is ongoing
- Which online community and which part of the online community space it occurred in
- Description of the incident
- Identifying information of the reported person such as name, online username, handle, email address, or IP address
- A link to the conversation
- Any logs or screenshots of the conversation
- Additional circumstances surrounding the incident
- Other people involved in or witnesses to the incident and their contact information or description

### Confidentiality
All reports will be kept confidential. When the CoC Board members discuss incidents with people who are reported, we will anonymize details as much as we can to protect reporter privacy.

However, some incidents happen in one-on-one interactions, and even if the details are anonymized, the reported person may be able to guess who made the report. If you have concerns about retaliation or your personal safety, please note those in your report. We still encourage you to report, so that we can support you while keeping our community members safe. In some cases, we can compile several anonymized reports into a pattern of behavior, and take action on that pattern.

In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that’s the case, the identities of all people impacted by the behavior and the people who reported that behavior will remain confidential, unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

The CoC Board provides transparency reports about the incidents that occurred. Anonymized information from the incident you report may be included in transparency reports. Please see details in the UbuCon Asia Code of Conduct CoC Board Procedure For Incident Response.

### Report Handling Procedure
When you make an incident report via email, you will receive an acknowledgment of your report within 24 hours of making the report.

If the incident is ongoing and needs to be immediately addressed, any one of the CoC Board members may take appropriate action to ensure the safety of everyone involved.

If the incident is less urgent, the CoC Board members will meet within 1 week to determine an appropriate response. In some cases, the CoC Board members may need to ask the person who made the report additional questions about the incident.

### Conflicts of Interest
If a CoC Board member has a conflict of interest for a report, they will recuse themselves from the discussion and handling of the incident. The incident documentation will not be available to them, and they will excuse themselves from any conversations involving handling the incident.

Should two or fewer CoC Board members remain to evaluate the report, A few members of UbuCon Asia Committee who are not CoC board could be invited additional decision maker on the incident. In case that is also not possible, the reported incident will be escalated to the Ubuntu Community Council.

### Following Up With Reporters
Within one week of an incident report, the CoC Board will follow up with the person who made the report and provided their contact information. The follow up may include:
- An acknowledgment that the UbuCon Asia online Code of Conduct CoC Board discussed the situation
- Whether or not the report was determined to be a violation of the Code of Conduct
- What actions (if any) were taken to correct the reported behavior

Sometimes reports take more time to discuss or follow up on. After one week of a report being open, the person who made the report will be provided with a status update. The status update will include a time frame for when the next update will be sent or the time frame in which the report is expected to be resolved.
